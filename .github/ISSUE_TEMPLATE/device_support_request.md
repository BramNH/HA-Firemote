**Device Name**
The official name of the device you own that is not yet supported.  The following link should be able to help you with this task: https://developer.amazon.com/docs/fire-tv/device-specifications-comparison-table.html

**Which compatability mode event number works best?**
Please test your device by trying all available "event0" - "event8" modes to find which one seems to work the best.  There is no need to test or list Strong or Default mode here.

**Optional Comments**
Add any other related comments here, or leave this blank.  Do all of your buttons seem to work except for a few?  Which ones?  Are certain event numbers faster to respond than others?
